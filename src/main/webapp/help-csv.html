<div>
  Required to load the plot data from a CSV file.
  One plotting option must be selected.

  The data series filename should specify the name of the csv file to load the data from.
  The column headings from the csv file are used as the labels of the points plotted.
      <h3>Known bugs:</h3>
      <ol>
		<li>BUG: Currently, only the first row of the csv file is plotted, this may be changed in the future.
		The csv plugin expects the first row to contain the column names, and subsequent rows to contain the values to be plotted on a per
		column basis.</li>
		<li>BUG: The csv plugin does not support click-able urls at the moment.</li>
		<li>BUG: The url should be configurable.</li>
      </ol>
